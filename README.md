# Geek Brains: Fundamentals of programming

This repository contains the files that are created and modified within the scope of the Geek Brains course **Fundamentals of programming**.

## Files:

* `hello.html` - The first step.
* `multiplication.html` - The multiplication action (`var`, `prompt`).
* `if-else-if-else.html` - The `if - else if - if` statement.
* `parseInt.html` - The `parseInt()` function.

## Cycles

* `cycle-while.html` - The WHILE cycle.
* `cycle-do.html` - The DO cycle.
* `cycle-for.html` - The FOR cycle (in this case the cycle is used for the bank calculation).

## Puzzle games:

* `puzzle-1-city.html` - A little game where a user is asked to answer questions about capitals.
* `puzzle-2.html` - Created a new game with only one "answers" variable and variable for each question.
* `puzzle-3.html` - Created a new game with one `score` and one `answer` variable. The `score` remembers the overall score (and changes after each question, if necessary). The same `answer` variable is used for each question and it can be assigned different values.      

## Shooting range games:

* `shooting-range-1.html` - The first version. The game checks whether a user hits one of two ranges. There is no support of detecting which target has been hit so far.
* `shooting-range-2.html` - A better version of the shooting game: 
  * Now the game knows how many shots a user have made.
  * The game informs a user about the number of a target has been eliminated.
  
## Russian roulette games: 

* `roulette-1.html` - The first version. The game counts the number of shots.
* `roulette-gb.html` - The example from the Geek Brains website. 
* `roulette-3.html` - The second version:
  * Now the game asks whether a user wants to play the game.
  * The game asks users whether they want to continue playing in case if the previous round was successful.
  * The game calls users' names in case if they quit playing.  
* `roulette-5.html` - The third version:
  * Now the game calls a user pussy if he refuses to play at the beginnin.
  * The game calls a user pussy if he agrees to play and refuses to make a first shot.
  * The game informs a user about his tragic destiny if he is done after the first round.
  * The game calculates the total number of rounds whether a user is done or whether he quits after a successful round. 
* `roulette-6.html` - The fourth version with improved logic.
* `roulette-8.html` - The fifth version: the game reacts differently when a user quits after the first round and when he quits after several ones.  

## Casino roulette games:
* `casino-roulette-1.html` - The sample from Geek Brains. Check the sequence of one color.

## P.S.
* `cat.html` - Verify the cat's essence.
* `cat-namer.html` - Pick a nickname for your cat.
