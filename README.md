# Geek Brains: Fundamentals of programming

This repository contains the files that are created and modified within the scope of the Geek Brains course **Fundamentals of programming**.

## Files:

* `hello.html` - The first step.
* `multiplication.html` - The multiplication action (`var`, `prompt`).
* `if-else-if-else.html` - The `if - else if - if` statement.
* `parseInt.html` - The `parseInt()` function.

### Puzzle games:

* `city-puzzle.html` - A little game where a user is asked to answer questions about capitals.
* `new-puzzle.html` - Created a new game with only one "answers" variable and variable for each question.
* `puzzle-3.html` - Created a new game with one `score` and one `answer` variable. The `score` remembers the overall score (and changes after each question, if necessary). The same `answer` variable is used for each question and it can be assigned different values.      

## P.S.
* `cat.html` - Verify the cat's essence.
